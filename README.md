# Stock Analyzer

App serves for quick evaluation of particular stock from US stock exchanges.

For fundamental analysis of a stock, it is necessary to get historical info, representing decissions and results of particular bussines.
I handled the task using quick.fs.net webpage's API, where is possible to acces required data. This task was a good practice of creating basic API requests and storing
results into convenient .csv format.

The process of stock evaluation uses basic methods of value investing, which I tried to implement in Python algorithm. Use of Pandas library was very convenient in this case.
In the end app offers quick calculation of many stock metrices, like debt ratios, intrinsic value, cashflow growth etc., requiring just the ticker symbol of particular stock. 
This project gave me new insights of Python modules, especially Pandas and served as a great learning experience.
